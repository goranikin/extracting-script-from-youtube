  " Even if I see your diff is gonna blow up production I will comment on it and be like this is gonna blow up production and then accept it and be like yeah, make sure he fixed that first right? This is Jake Bullham He's a principal engineer or ICA that Instagram who got promoted twice from staff engineer So I think ICA was like so let's go and put him on one of the projects we have that is like impossible and everyone thinks this is stupid and yet his work like balance is somehow reasonable There's only a pretty good balance. Yes, and it's all",
  " the systems that have been building my whole career that I think I like able to keep me here. I thought he had a really interesting note-taking system and my note-taking system was actually in VS code and he shared a lot more than you might think. I'm also a bit of a loose unit and sometimes say dumb stuff. Here's the full episode. Your work has such insane blast radius because you got to ICA, or principal engineer in the industry, on your path to ICA, what were you hired in as Tameda?",
  " And maybe you can give a high level timeline of the teams you were on. Yeah. Sure thing. Yes, I came to Meta as a six and actually joined Facebook groups at the time. So groups went from, I don't know, 10 or 15 people to like 700 in like two or three years. But yes, I joined right at the peak of it like 700. Yeah. And I was on some team like groups integrity was actually pretty wild for me. I had a pretty slow wrap up to Meta because I joined when they, it was middle of COVID.",
  " I think my manager helped a lot",
  " and I managed to get a meat soul or something like this. You know, definitely wasn't makes selling. I had a few little projects that probably helped them sell that, but yeah, I'm pretty sure they told us slow onboarding. So during PSC, yeah, which was kind of crazy, especially because groups was like so critical at the time, right there had so many engineers. And right after that, I actually just, I just decided to switch teams because had some friends in Instagram and they were like, yo, come and work on Instagram web.",
  " And this is actually going to be a bit of a theme throughout my career. So I joined Meta to work on UIs, right? So work on web to use React. I loved React. And I joined this group's integrity team. We weren't doing really any of that. Like I was doing like 20% of the time, but most of the time with back end systems, right? So I was like, OK, cool. I'll move to this team. So as your background, before Meta, all more like full stack or front end work. Yeah. So I spent, I started coding it a really young age and it was all",
  " And then when I went to companies, I would like to be like front end product. And every single company I've ever worked at moved me into like front end infrastructure very quickly. And then back end infrastructure. Actually, one of my big draws to meta was, oh, they're so big. I'll always be able to work on front end product. Right. Specializing. Yeah. And this thing continued where I got pulled into Instagram now to do front end product was like awesome within a couple months. I was on the front end infrastructure team. Yeah. Yeah. In Instagram. And then yeah.",
  " within like a year I was on the back end of the structure team. So I was like, oh, it doesn't matter which company I'm after. How do you, how do you get getting pulled to the back end? Like what is drawing you? I think well, now because it's, you've done it so many times. You end up knowing like a lot of outed and like all the different like architecture and the systems that you have to sort of put together. And it, it just, it is more impactful now, right? With the big switch to mobile, the only thing that's like rivaling it is the server, right?",
  " like web has become such a small amount of out traffic. You've got to go to where the more important stack is. I see, so generally you are picking projects based off of where the impact is and that is leading you to go to back-end stuff. Like, yeah, exactly. Like on, at Instagram, we probably had like less than 100 people would work on it, you know, around the company, right time. And on the back end, we have like 2,000, 3000 in trade. Right. Right. Right. Right.",
  " So even from the engineering point of view. Right. Right. So then so then you were I see six on the group's team. You were onboarding slowly. Yeah. And you weren't liking it. It was just back-end integrity system. You switched the Instagram web as I see six. Is that? Yes. Okay. And so that's where your career started to really pick up. Yes. So I think it came in and like had all the skill sets. So I was like basically ramped up immediately and like landing impact immediately.",
  " you"
